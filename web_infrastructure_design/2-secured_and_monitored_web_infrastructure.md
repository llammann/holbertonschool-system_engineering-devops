# Advanced Web Stack Design with Security and Monitoring

## Overview

This document describes an enhanced web infrastructure design incorporating security and monitoring features. It includes three firewalls, an SSL certificate for HTTPS, and monitoring clients to ensure the infrastructure’s performance and security.

## Infrastructure Components

### 1. **Servers**
- **Definition**: Physical or virtual machines used to host the infrastructure components.

### 2. **Web Server (Nginx)**
- **Purpose**: Handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

### 3. **Application Server**
- **Purpose**: Executes application code, processes business logic, and interacts with the database.

### 4. **Load Balancer (HAProxy)**
- **Purpose**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.

### 5. **Database (MySQL)**
- **Purpose**: Stores and manages application data. Utilizes a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) configuration for read and write operations.

### 6. **Firewalls (3 Units)**
- **Purpose**: Protects the infrastructure by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on security rules.
  - **First Firewall**: Positioned at the perimeter of the network to block unauthorized access and attacks from the internet.
  - **Second Firewall**: Protects internal services and databases, limiting access to only necessary services.
  - **Third Firewall**: Secures communication between internal servers, ensuring only legitimate traffic is allowed.

### 7. **SSL Certificate**
- **Purpose**: Encrypts traffic between users and the web server to protect sensitive information and ensure data integrity. 

### 8. **Monitoring Clients (3 Units)**
- **Purpose**: Collects and analyzes data to track system performance, detect issues, and ensure uptime.
  - **Sumologic or Other Monitoring Services**: Collects logs and metrics from various components of the infrastructure.
  - **Data Collectors**: Installed on servers to gather performance metrics, logs, and health data.

## Detailed Explanations

### 1. **Role of Firewalls**
- **Security**: Firewalls filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules, preventing unauthorized access and mitigating potential attacks.
- **Placement**:
  - **Perimeter**: Protects against external threats.
  - **Internal**: Limits access to internal resources.
  - **Inter-server**: Ensures secure communication between internal components.

### 2. **Why HTTPS?**
- **Data Encryption**: HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between users and the server, protecting against eavesdropping and data breaches.
- **Trust**: An SSL certificate ensures users that the site is secure, enhancing trust and credibility.

### 3. **Monitoring**
- **Purpose**: Monitors system health, performance, and security to detect issues early and ensure smooth operation.
- **Data Collection**:
  - **Metrics**: Performance data such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic.
  - **Logs**: Application and system logs are analyzed for errors and unusual activity.

### 4. **Monitoring Web Server QPS (Queries Per Second)**
- **Setup**: To monitor QPS, configure your monitoring tool to collect data on the number of requests handled by the web server over time.
- **Analysis**: Use the collected data to identify traffic patterns, detect potential bottlenecks, and optimize performance.

## Issues and Considerations

### 1. **Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer**
- **Issue**: While terminating SSL at the load balancer simplifies SSL management, it introduces a risk if the internal network is not secure. Encrypted traffic between the load balancer and backend servers can be intercepted if not properly protected.

### 2. **Single Write-Enabled MySQL Server**
- **Issue**: Having only one MySQL server capable of handling writes creates a single point of failure for write operations. If this server fails, the application cannot perform any write operations, leading to data loss or downtime.

### 3. **Servers with Identical Components**
- **Issue**: Having servers with identical roles (web server, application server, and database server) can lead to inefficiencies. For instance, a single server handling all tasks may become a bottleneck under high load. It’s crucial to have a balanced distribution of roles and responsibilities to optimize performance and scalability.

## Conclusion

The enhanced web infrastructure design incorporates critical security measures and monitoring to improve reliability and performance. By understanding the role of each component and addressing potential issues, you can build a robust and secure system that efficiently handles traffic and data.
